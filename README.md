# TurboFanEngineCycleAnalysis

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts dedicated to evaluating and visualizing the performance of a high-bypass ratio, two-spool, separate exhaust turbofan engine. It allows users to explore how varying parameters like Bypass Ratio (BPR), Fan Pressure Ratio (FPR), and Compressor Pressure Ratio (CPR) impact key engine performance metrics.

## Features
- Calculation and visualization of TurboFan engine performance metrics.
- Evaluation based on different engine configurations and operating conditions.
- Key metrics analyzed include thrust-to-mass flow rate, specific fuel consumption, and various efficiencies.

## Prerequisites
Before running the scripts, ensure you have installed the necessary packages:
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy pandas
